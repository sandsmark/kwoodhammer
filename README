KWoodhammer 1.00
----------------

This simple KDE-style program is thought to handle
the most popular methods formerly used for cryptography
in one place. Even if a text is encrypted with multiple
keys and methods it is possible to find out the cleartext,
because KWoodhammer provides an efficient step-by-step
algorithm.

The KWoodhammer homepage is http://kwoodhammer.sourceforge.net.
Some documentation is also available there.
The KWoodhammer Contest was running at http://www.maux.de,
my personal homepage.
